Due to the large size of the Django project files (including virtual environment and other heavy directories), I'm unable to upload the entire project to GitHub.
Instead, you can access and download the complete project from my Google Drive:

Google Drive Link: []

This Drive folder contains:
- The full Django project code
- Instructions to run it locally
- Pre-installed virtual environment (optional)

If you face any issues accessing the files or running the project, feel free to contact me.

Thank you!
